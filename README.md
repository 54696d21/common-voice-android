This is not the official app of the Common Voice project by Mozilla. This app is developed by Saverio Morelli, using the Android Studio IDE.

### How contribute

If you want to help to develop this app, you can open an `Issue` an send feedback about the features or report bugs.

You can contribute also to translate the app (follow every step, please):

1. **Open a new issue** (use `Translation` template), so others know you are translating the app in that language
1. Then go to [Crowdin](https://bit.ly/3bNBoUU), choose your language (you can ask for a new language if it’s not in the list) and translate strings.

_If your language is not now supported by [Common Voice](https://voice.mozilla.org/it), **don't worry!** You can translate the app anyway, when it will be supported, the app will be already translated in your language!_

### Why an Android app of Common Voice?

There is already the website, which is responsive and mobile-friendly, but actually it’s very slow because of so many animations and graphic effects, which distract and annoy you. So, this app want to improve the experience of this fantastic project. You can see statistics, voices online; you can set the daily goal (it's not the same of Common Voice website); you can record sentences and validate clips, with a few taps. **You can validate and record when you are not connected to the Internet too!** So, the app is smart, customisable, light, and **powerful**.

### Gestures

You can turn on/off "Gestures" in Settings. These are the supported gestures (now):

|                         **Swipe-up**                         |                        **Swipe-left**                        |                       **Swipe-right**                        |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |

| In **Speak** and **Listen** you can swipe-up to *Report* a clip/sentence | In **Speak**, **Listen**, **Login**, **Profile**, **All badges** you can swipe-left to go back (so, it's the some action of "back button") | In **Speak** and **Listen** you can swipe-right to *Skip* the clip/sentence |
| [**removed**] ~~In **Tutorial** you can swipe-up to see *Terms* (just the first view of tutorial)~~ | In **Tutorial**, **First-run Listen** and **First-run Speak** you can swipe-left to go back to the previous view ("to navigate") | In **Tutorial**, **First-run Listen** and **First-run Speak** you can swipe-right to go forward to the next view ("to navigate") |
