The app doesnâ€™t collect your data. Anyway, some data are saved on your device (*user_id* of CV, *selected language*, *validations and recordings number*, and others data). You can clear them just *Clear data* of the app (but they are necessary to use Common Voice Android).

The app requires *Storage* and *Microphone* permissions when you use *Speak section*: because the app saves your recording, but then they are deleted automatically.

If you active "Save log on a file", the app requires *Storage* and will be save log on files, but it won't contains your personal data. Read more about this [**here**](./SAVING THE LOG.md).

The *Experimental features* could be unsafe and unstable, so pay attention if you use that option.

If you want additional information about the Policy privacy of Common Voice project, [Read the official doc](https://voice.mozilla.org/en/privacy) by Mozilla.

### Anonymous statistics

*You can disable Anonymous Statistics always, in Settings. If you disable statistics, you will not be in public statistics, but app sent anyway data to my database.*

These statistics are absolutely anonymous. I don't collect your personal data. The first time (per day) you run the app, they send: **unique_id**, **language**, **logged_status**, **version** and **status_statistics**.

**unique_id**: It's a unique string generated the first time you run the app, and it is like "UserYYYYMMDDHHMMSSMMMM::CVAppSav", so it doesn't contain any your personal data

**language**: it's just the variable, like _en_ or _it_, ect.

**logged_status**: it's a integer value: 0 if you are not logged, 1 if you logged-in

**version**: it's the version_code, it's useful to know if users use the latest releases

**status_statistics**: it's a flag "true" or "false". If the statistics are turned on in the app, it's true, otherwise it's false.

You can see public statistics on website: https://saveriomorelli.com/app/common-voice-android/statistics.
