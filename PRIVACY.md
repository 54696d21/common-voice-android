The app doesnâ€™t collect your data. Anyway, some data are saved on your device (*user_id* of CV, *selected language*, *validations and recordings number*). You can clear them just *Clear data* of the app (but they are necessary to use Common Voice Android App).

The app requires *Storage* and *Microphone* permissions when you use *Speak section*: because the app saves your recording, but then they are deleted automatically.

If you want additional information about the Policy privacy of Common Voice project, [Read the official doc](https://voice.mozilla.org/en/privacy) by Mozilla.
