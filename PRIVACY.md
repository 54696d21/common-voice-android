The app doesnâ€™t collect your data. Anyway, some data are saved on your device (*user_id* of CV, *selected language*, *validations and recordings number*). You can clear them just *Clear data* of the app (but they are necessary to use Common Voice Android App).

The app requires *Storage* and *Microphone* permissions when you use *Speak section*: because the app saves your recording, but then they are deleted automatically.

If you active "Save log on a file", the app requires *Storage* and will be save log on files, but it won't contains your personal data.

The *Experimental features* could be unsafe and unstable, so pay attention if you use that option.
