# SAVING THE LOG

If you turned on this option, in Settings, the app will save logs on files.

Every time you open the app, it will create a new log file, named like this "<code>log[year][month][day][seconds][milliseconds].txt</code>" and the app will be save every log there (also exception/error/message that aren't not printed and visible normally. The app automatically will delete files in "safe mode", basically in the device will be max 7 log files.

**This feature needs "Storage" permission to work.**

Your data, of course, will **not** be saved. The log files will contain messages about the app, not about you.



### Why should you activate this feature?

If you open an issue for a bug, for example, you can attach the last (or the lasts) log files in that issue (or you can send them privately to Telegram (<code>Sav22999</code>)). In this way, the developer could save early the bug :smile: (and in the best way).
